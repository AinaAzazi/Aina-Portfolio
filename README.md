# **Project 1: Classification of User Comments on YouTube** (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00380/)
# https://github.com/AinaAzazi/Project-1.git

This is a project that I did by following the tutorial from the instructor during my learning of Naive Bayes classification.

* Algorithms used: Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier. 
* MultinomialNB is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where it analyse categorical text data.
* In this project, the model classified the comments as ham or spam based on the probability of each tag (ham or spam).
* Naive bayes perform well in categorical data.


# **Project 2: Prediction mode of transportation taken by individual based on their salary and age.**
# https://github.com/AinaAzazi/Project-2.git
This is a project that I did by following the tutorial from the instructor during my learning of Naive Bayes classification.

* Data was provided by the instructor and included in my Github
* Algorithms used: Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier. 
* This algorithms supports continuous data 
* Assumes that continuous values associated with each class and distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution.
* In this project, the model classified the mode of transportation whether it is LRT or car based on the given age and salary.
